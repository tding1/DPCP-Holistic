 Code of paper “Dual Principal Component Pursuit for Robust Subspace Learning:Theory and Algorithms for a Holistic Approach”, ICML 2021
=====

This code has been tested to run in MATLAB R2018b. In the folder:

- `demo.m` provides quick examples of running different methods and reports their results.

- `plot_rsgm_vary_beta.m` produces Figure 3 (a)-(b) in the paper.

- `plot_rsgm_vary_d.m` produces Figure 3 (c)-(d) in the paper.

- `plot_rsgm_vary_r.m` plots the convergence results of RSGM with varying outlier ratio.

- `syn_exp.m` provides examples of generating Figure 4 in the paper.
